# Error Bit Decoding

This is a github repo for current research conducted at the UPRRP for Graph Neural Network decoders and their use in bit error correction from a transmiter and a reciever through a noisy channel.

They are our focus of study due to current algorithms for error decoding codes such as LDPC codes that use the Sum Product Algorithm for decoding. Essentially we are trying to better them through the heuristic approach that neural networks provide.

  ## Overview

This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks and a `Journal.md` file. 

- `NeuralDemapper.ipynb` Using the Sionna framework, there is an implementation of a End-to-End channel that uses a demapper/decoder Neural Network containing 3 dense layers.

- `HammingCode.ipynb` Simple implementation of Hamming Codes using numpy. 

- `quintuple_decoder.ipynb` Implements some functions for creating bit data, thien id decodes them using Majority Voting System algorithm. This algorithm is compared to a 2 layer dense Neural Network.
