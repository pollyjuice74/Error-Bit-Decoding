# To-Do
- Create a SPA NN decoder

- BCH, Autoencoders, GNN

- Making a small autoencoder network maybe 5-3-5 or 5-2-1-2-5, with nodes that are more complex than others like the single one connecting  5-2-1-2-5

- Dropout on small autoencoder

## Ideas
- Instead of deciphering the noisy data, decipher the noise
